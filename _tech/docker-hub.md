> Docker Hub is the public [Docker](/tech/docker/) image registry service
from Docker Inc. It is based on the open source [Docker
Registry](https://github.com/docker/distribution/blob/master/docs/index.md)
that allows to set up private, on-premise docker registries. A
commercial SaaS offering called *Docker Trusted Registry* exists to
serve private images without the need for own infrastructure.

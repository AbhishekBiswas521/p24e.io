> Hipache is a fully-featured distributed proxy
> designed to route high volumes of HTTP and WebSocket traffic to
> unusually large numbers of virtual hosts, in a highly dynamic topology
> where backends are added and removed several times per second. It is
> particularly well-suited for PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) and other
> environments that are both business-critical and multi-tenant.

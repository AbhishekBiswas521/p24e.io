In dynamically changing infrastructures, locating logs of a
specific service or infrastructure component is a non-trivial
task. Logs may be scattered among various hosts or are just
written to stdout, like its considered good practice with
[12-factor-apps](/tech/12factor).
Tools to collect and aggregate logs are needed to deal with
this, and might integrate with [monitoring](/components/monitoring)
tools.

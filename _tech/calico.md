> Project Calico represents a new approach to virtual networking, based on
the same scalable IP networking principles as the Internet. Unlike other
virtual networking approaches, Calico does not use overlays, instead
providing a pure Layer 3 approach to data center networking. Calico is
simple to deploy and diagnose, provides a rich security policy, supports
both IPv4 and IPv6 and can be used across a combination of bare-metal,
VM and container workloads

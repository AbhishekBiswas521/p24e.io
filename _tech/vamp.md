> Vamp, or the Very Awesome Microservices Platform, takes the pain out of running complex and critical service based architectures. Vamp's core features are a platform-agnostic microservices DSL, A-B testing/canary releasing on everything and a deep metrics & event engine that monitors everything and directly feeds back into your services. We are currently in alpha but you can already start kicking the tires!

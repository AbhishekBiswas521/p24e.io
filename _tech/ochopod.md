> Ochopod is a Python package that performs automatic orchestration for containers running over Mesos or Kubernetes. It does rely on Zookeeper for synchronization and is built using the cool Pykka actor system port. You can easily embed Ochopod in your Docker containers and address complex situations where various systems cross-reference each others at run-time.

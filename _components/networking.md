The dynamic nature of programmable infrastructure makes traditional approaches of networking, like manually assigned IP addresses, ports or hostnames unworkable.
Components that may exist on the same physical host or network at one point, might well be separated by a WAN and located in different data centers. SDN solutions that integrate deeply with the programmable infrastructure are required to make all this complexity transparent to the user.

> The promise of Docker is that it simplifies application deployment, allows greater application density on hosts, and features a portable format that offers unparalleled flexibility over standard packaging. But one thing Docker doesnâ€™t get you is the simplicity of `yum install foo` to install an application. Nor can Docker define or process a directed graph of container orchestration dependencies. We aim to change that.

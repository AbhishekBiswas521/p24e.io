title: Twelve Factor App
component: paradigms

> In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service.
> The twelve-factor app is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:
> * Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
> * Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
> * Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
> * Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
> * And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

The physical location and count of individual instances of services in a programmable infrastructure environment is not commonly known upfront. Service Discovery mechanisms are required so services can talk to each other and requests from outside can be routed to healthy instances ready to service them.

One central element of many solutions for Service Discovery is a distributed, strongly consistent datastore that acts as service registry where service instances can be announced to and queried from.
